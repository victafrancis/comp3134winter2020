1) The results are expected because only rows with active=1 will show up. Ben has active=0.

2) Ben still showed even if my condition specifically said not to include users where active=0.
Definitely this is not the expected output.

3) There are no results after the search, possibly because of the conditions.
This should be the expected output.
